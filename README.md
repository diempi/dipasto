# Dipasto

**Dipasto** is an engaging blockchain project that blends the excitement of exploration with the world of NFTs. It starts with a simple QR code scan, leading users to create an account or log in using their existing wallet.

## Core Experience:

- **Collectible NFT Stamps**: As users visit various locations, like restaurants, they can scan QR codes to collect unique NFT stamps. These digital souvenirs, stored securely in the user's wallet, serve as lasting mementos of their experiences.

- **Social Sharing**: Users can showcase their collected NFT stamps on social networks, spreading the word about the places they've visited and creating organic publicity for these establishments.

- **Rewards for Exploration**: The more a user explores and collects, the more they unlock exclusive benefits. Accumulating certain NFTs can lead to rewards like discounts at hotels, restaurants, museums, and more.

Dipasto is not just an app; it's a gateway to a world of discovery, where every visit and every experience is immortalized on the blockchain and shared with a community of like-minded adventurers.
